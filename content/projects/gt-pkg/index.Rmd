With the **gt** package, anyone can make wonderful-looking tables using the **R** programming language. The **gt** philosophy: we can construct a wide variety of useful tables with a cohesive set of table parts. These include the table header, the stub, the stub head, the column labels, the table body, and the table footer.

The gt API is designed to be both straightforward yet powerful. The emphasis is on simple functions for the everyday display table needs. However, there are functions for customizing and annotating tables to convey additional information.
