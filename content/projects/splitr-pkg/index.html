<p><strong>splitr</strong> is an R package for conducting trajectory and dispersion modeling with HYSPLIT. This is useful for atmospheric scientists as the package helps to determine, from one or more receptor sites, where arriving air masses originated. Conversely, it’s possible to model trajectories of air masses from receptor sites. Forward and backward modeling of gas-phase or particulate matter can also be conducted from defined sites. It’s a means to help explain how, where, and when chemicals and materials are atmospherically transported, dispersed, and deposited.</p>
