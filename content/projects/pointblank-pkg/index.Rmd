The **pointblank** package let's us validate data in local data frames or tibbles, in CSV and TSV files, and in database tables (PostgreSQL and MySQL). We can get a detailed summary report of the interrogation, showing how many individual tests in each validation step had passed or failed. The self-contained HTML report provides detailed information on the validation outcomes and it can be used as web content.
