The **DiagrammeR** package has a collection of graph functions allow you to create graph objects, modify those graphs, get information from the graphs, and do many other useful things. We can easily generate network graphs with data available in tabular datasets. Two specialized data frames contain node data and attributes (node data frames) and edges with associated edge attributes (edge data frames). Because the attributes are always kept alongside the node and edge definitions (within the graph object itself), we can easily work with them.
