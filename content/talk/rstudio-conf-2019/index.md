abstract: With the gt package, anyone can make great-looking display tables. Though the package is still early in development, you can do some really great things with it right now! I'll walk through a few examples that touch upon the more common table-making use cases. These will include features like adding table parts, integrating footnotes, styling/transforming table cells, using tables in R Markdown documents, and even including gt tables in email messages.
